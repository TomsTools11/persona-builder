# **Persona Builder**

### Description

The **Persona Builder** turns a website URL and/or uploaded research materials into a set of clear, actionable user personas. It extracts likely user segments, goals, pain points, and behaviors, then outputs a polished PDF with **personas, JTBD statements, key scenarios, and a ready-to-use interview/survey guide**—so teams can align on who they’re building for and make better product and messaging decisions fast.
